
Introduction:

 SpringBoot-RabbitMq is an open-source, CableTV Management framework written entirely in Java on top of the Spring framework.

Key Features and Technologies: 

Gradle Build Tool

Gradle is an open source build automation system that builds upon the concepts of Apache Ant and Apache Maven and introduces a Groovy-based domain-specific language (DSL) instead of the XML form used by Apache Maven of declaring the project configuration.

Java Server Faces(JSF) / PrimeFaces.

JavaServer Faces (JSF) is a Java-based web application framework intended to simplify development integration of web-based user interfaces. UI component implement to  PrimeFaces. PrimeFaces is a component suite open source User Interface (UI) component library for JavaServer Faces (JSF) based applications.

Spring Framework

Spring is the enterprise Java platform. It provides numerous features, including dependency injection and transaction control.

Security

Spring Security provides a robust security framework for controlling authentication and authorization at both the code and page level and is utilized by Application for access control.

Persistence

JPA and Hibernate represent ORM infrastructure for controlling persistence of our rich domain model.

MySQL 
 MySql is an open-source relational database management system (RDBMS). 
Email

Email support is provided throughout the framework in either synchronous or asynchronous (Spring Batch) modes. Email presentation customization is achieved via velocity templates.

Spring Batch 

Spring Batch provides reusable functions that are essential in processing large volumes of records, including job processing statistics, job restart, skip, and resource management. Simple as well as complex, high-volume batch jobs can leverage the framework in a highly scalable manner to process significant volumes of information.

RabbitMQ 

RabbitMQ is an open source message broker software (sometimes called message-oriented middleware) that implements the Advanced Message Queuing Protocol (AMQP). JMS can be used as a mechanism to allow asynchronous HTTP request processing.
